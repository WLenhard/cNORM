\title{Derivative of regression model}
\usage{
derive(model, order = 1, covariate = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{The regression model}

\item{order}{The degree of the derivate, default: 1}

\item{covariate}{In case, a covariate has been used, please specify the degree of the covariate /
the specific value here.}
}
\value{
The derived coefficients
}
\description{
Calculates the derivative of the location / norm value from the regression model with the first
derivative as the default. This is useful for finding violations of model assumptions and problematic
distribution features as f. e. bottom and ceiling effects, non-progressive norm scores within an
age group or in general #' intersecting percentile curves.
}
\examples{
normData <- prepareData()
m <- bestModel(normData)
derivedCoefficients <- derive(m)
