\title{Weighted rank estimation}
\usage{
weighted.rank(x, weights = NULL, n = 1000, type = "Type7")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numerical vector}

\item{weights}{A numerical vector with weights; should have the same length as x}

\item{n}{Granularity for approximation}

\item{type}{Type of estimator, can either be "Harrell-Davis" using a beta function to
approximate the weighted percentiles (Harrell & Davis, 1982) or "Type7" (default; Hyndman & Fan, 1996), an adaption
of the generic quantile function in R, including weighting. All code based on the work of Akinshin (2020).}

\description{
Conducts weighted ranking on the basis of either the weighted Harrell-Davis quantile estimator
or an adaption of the type 7 quantile estimator of the generic quantile function in the base
package. Please provide a vector with raw values and an additional vector with the weight of each
observation. In case the weight vector is NULL, a normal ranking is done. The vectors may not
include NAs and the weights should be positive non-zero values.
