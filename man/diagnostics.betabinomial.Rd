\title{Diagnostic Information for Beta-Binomial Model}
\usage{
diagnostics.betabinomial(model, age = NULL, raw = NULL, weights = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An object of class "cnormBetaBinomial", typically the result of a call to cnorm.betabinomial().}

\item{age}{An optional vector with age values}

\item{raw}{An optional vector with raw values}

\item{weights}{An optional vector with weights}
}
\value{
A list containing the following diagnostic information:
\itemize{
  \item converged: Logical indicating whether the optimization algorithm converged.
  \item n_evaluations: Number of function evaluations performed during optimization.
  \item n_gradient: Number of gradient evaluations performed during optimization.
  \item final_value: Final value of the objective function (negative log-likelihood).
  \item message: Any message returned by the optimization algorithm.
  \item AIC: Akaike Information Criterion.
  \item BIC: Bayesian Information Criterion.
  \item max_gradient: Maximum absolute gradient at the solution (if available).
}
}
\description{
This function provides diagnostic information for a fitted beta-binomial model
from the cnorm.betabinomial function. It returns various metrics related to
model convergence, fit, and complexity. In case, age and raw scores are provided,
the function as well computes R2, rmse and bias for the norm scores based on
the manifest and predicted norm scores
}
\details{
The AIC and BIC are calculated as:
AIC = 2k - 2ln(L)
BIC = ln(n)k - 2ln(L)
where k is the number of parameters, L is the maximum likelihood, and n is the number of observations.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Fit a beta-binomial model
model <- cnorm.betabinomial(ppvt$age, ppvt$raw)

# Get diagnostic information
diag_info <- diagnostics.betabinomial(model)

# Print the diagnostic information
print(diag_info)

# Check if the model converged
if(diag_info$converged) {
  cat("Model converged successfully.\n")
} else {
  cat("Warning: Model did not converge.\n")
}

# Compare AIC and BIC
cat("AIC:", diag_info$AIC, "\n")
cat("BIC:", diag_info$BIC, "\n")
