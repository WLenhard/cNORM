\title{Summary of cnormLasso Model}
\usage{
\method{summary}{cnormLasso}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class "cnormLasso", typically the result of a call to cnorm.lasso().}
}
\value{
Prints a summary of the cnormLasso model and invisibly returns NULL.
}
\description{
This function provides a summary of a cnormLasso model, including various measures of model fit,
LASSO details, model parameters, selected variables, and coefficients.
}
\details{
The summary includes the following information:
\itemize{
  \item Model Fit Statistics: R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, RMSE, MAE, AIC, and BIC
  \item LASSO Details: Lambda value, Lambda index, and monotonicity status
  \item Model Parameters: Maximum powers for location and age, number of predictors
  \item Selected Variables: List of variables selected by LASSO
  \item Coefficients: Estimated coefficients for all terms in the model
}
}
\examples{
model <- cnorm.lasso(elfe$raw, elfe$group)
summary(model)
