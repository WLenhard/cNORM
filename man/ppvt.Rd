\description{
A dataset based on an unstratified sample of PPVT4 data (German adaption), including demographic data like
age, sex, school form, migration background and language spoken at home. The PPVT4 consists of blocks of items with
12 items each. Each item consists of 4 pictures. The test taker is given a word orally and he or she has to point out
the picture matching the oral word. Bottom and ceiling blocks of items are determined according to age and performance. For
instance, when a student knows less than 4 word from a block of 12 items, the testing stops.
