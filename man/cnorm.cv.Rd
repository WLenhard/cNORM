\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame of norm sample with ranking, powers and interaction of L and A or a cnorm object}

\item{formula}{prespecified formula, e. g. from an existing regression model; min and max functions will be ignored
In case a cnorm object is used, this functions automatically draws on the formula of the inbuilt regression
function}

\item{repetitions}{number of repetitions for cross validation}

\item{norms}{determine norm score crossfit and R2 (if set to TRUE). The option is
computationally intensive and duration increases with sample size, number of
repetitions and maximum number of terms (max option).}

\item{min}{Minimum number of terms to start from, default = 1}

\item{max}{Maximum number of terms in model up to 2*k + k^2}

\item{cv}{If set to full (default), the data is split into training and validation data and ranked afterwards,
otherwise, a pre ranked dataset has to be provided, which is then split into train and validation (and thus
only the modeling, but not the ranking is independent)}

\item{pCutoff}{The function checks the stratification for unbalanced data sampling.
It performs a t-test per group. pCutoff specifies the p-value per group that the test result
has to reach at least. To minimize beta error, the value is set to .2 per default}

\item{width}{If provided, ranking is done via rankBySlidingWindow, otherwise by group}

\item{raw}{Name of the raw variable}

\item{group}{Name of the grouping variable}

\item{age}{Name of the age variable}

\item{weights}{Name of the weighting parameter}

table with results per term number, including RMSE for raw scores in training, validation and complete
sample, R2 for the norm scores and the crossfit measure (1 = ideal, <1 = underfit, >1 = overfit)
}
\description{
This function helps in selecting the number of terms for the model by doing repeated
Monte Carlo cross validation with 80 percent of the data as training data and 20 percent as
the validation data. The cases are drawn randomly but stratified by norm group. Successive
models are retrieved with increasing number of terms and the RMSE of raw scores (fitted by
the regression model) is plotted for the training, validation and the complete dataset.
Additionally to this analysis on the raw score level, it is possible (default) to estimate
the mean norm score reliability and crossfit measures. For this, please set the norms parameter
to TRUE. Due to the high computational load when computing norm scores, it takes time to finish
when doing repeated cv or comparing models up to the maximum number of terms. When using
the cv = "full" option, the ranking is done for the test and validation dataset
separately (always based on T scores), resulting in a complete cross validation. In
order to only validate the modeling, you as well can use a pre-ranked data set with
prepareData(elfe) already applied. In this case, the training and validation data is
drawn from the already ranked data and the scores for the validation set should improve.
It is however no independent test, as the ranking between both samples is interlinked.
In the output, you will get RMSE for the raw score models, norm score R2 and delta R2, the crossfit
and the norm score SE sensu Oosterhuis, van der Ark, & Sijtsma (2016).
For assessing, if a model over-fits the data and to what extent, we need cross-validation. We assumed
that an overfitting occurred when a model captures more variance of the observed norm scores of the
training sample compared to the captured variance of the norm scores of the validation sample. The
overfit can therefore be described as:
\deqn{CROSSFIT = R(Training; Model)^2 / R(Validation; Model)^2}
A CROSSFIT higher than 1 is a sign of overfitting. Value lower than 1 indicate an underfit due to a
suboptimal modeling procedure, i. e. the method may not have captured all the variance of the observed
data it could possibly capture. Values around 1 are ideal, as long as the raw score RMSE is low and the
norm score validation R2 reaches high levels. As a suggestion for real tests:
\itemize{
  \item Use visual inspection of the percentiles with plotPercentiles or plotPercentileSeries
  \item Combine the visual inspection of the percentiles with a repeated cross validation (e. g. 10 repetitions)
  \item Focus on low raw score RMSE, high norm score R2 in the validation dataset and
avoid a number of terms with a high overfit (e. g. crossfit > 1.1).

\examples{
# plot cross validation RMSE by number of terms up to 9 with three repetitions
result <- cnorm(raw = elfe$raw, group = elfe$group)
cnorm.cv(result$data, min = 2, max = 9, repetitions = 3)

# Applying the function to a cnorm object only investigates the already
# determined formula
cnorm.cv(result, repetitions = 1)
