## Resubmission
This is a minor release of an existing package. In this version I have:

*    corrected a bug in 'bestModel'
*    added new features on parametric modelling via beta binomial functions


## Test environments
* local WIN10, 64Bit install, R 4.3.1
* winbuilder win release, win old release, win development and mac release


## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. There were NOTES on potential link and DOI issues in DESCRIPTION, which are correct, however.

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
