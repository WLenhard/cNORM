Description: A comprehensive toolkit for generating continuous test norms in 
    psychometrics and biometrics, and analyzing model fit. The package offers both 
    distribution-free modeling using Taylor polynomials and parametric modeling 
    using the beta-binomial and the 'Sinh-Arcsinh' distribution. Originally developed
    for achievement tests, it is applicable to a wide range of mental, physical, or 
    other test scores dependent on continuous or discrete explanatory variables. The
    package provides several advantages: It minimizes deviations from representativeness 
    in subsamples, interpolates between discrete levels of explanatory variables, 
    and significantly reduces the required sample size compared to conventional 
    norming per age group. cNORM enables graphical and analytical evaluation of 
    model fit, accommodates a wide range of scales including those with negative 
    and descending values, and even supports conventional norming. It generates 
    norm tables including confidence intervals. It also includes methods for 
    addressing representativeness issues through Iterative Proportional Fitting.
