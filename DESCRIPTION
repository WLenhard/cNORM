Description: A comprehensive toolkit for generating continuous test norms in 
     psychometrics and biometrics, and analyzing model fit. The package offers 
     both distribution-free modeling using Taylor polynomials and parametric 
     modeling using the beta-binomial and the 'Sinh-Arcsinh' distribution. 
     Originally developed for achievement tests, it is applicable to a wide 
     range of mental, physical, or other test scores dependent on continuous or 
     discrete explanatory variables. The package provides several advantages: 
     It minimizes deviations from representativeness in subsamples, interpolates 
     between discrete levels of explanatory variables, and significantly reduces 
     the required sample size compared to conventional norming per age group. 
     cNORM enables graphical and analytical evaluation of model fit, 
     accommodates a wide range of scales including those with negative and 
     descending values, and even supports conventional norming. It generates 
     norm tables including confidence intervals. It also includes methods for 
     addressing representativeness issues through Iterative Proportional Fitting.
