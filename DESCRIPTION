Description: Conventional methods for producing test norms are often plagued with "jumps" or "gaps"
    (i.e., discontinuities) in norm tables and low confidence for assessing extreme scores. Non-parametric
    Continuous Norming generates continuous test norms on the basis of the raw data from norming samples, 
    without requiring assumptions about the distribution of the raw data: Norm values are directly established
    from raw data by modeling the latter ones as a function of both percentile scores and an explanatory
    variable (e.g., age). The method minimizes bias arising from sampling and measurement error, while 
    handling marked deviations from normality, addressing bottom or ceiling effects and capturing almost
    all of the variance in the original norm data sample.
