#' Weighting of cases through iterative proportional fitting (Raking)
#'
#' Computes and standardizes weights via raking to compensate for non-stratified
#' samples. It is based on the implementation in the survey R package. It reduces
#' data collection biases in the norm data by the means of post stratification,
#' thus reducing the effect of unbalanced data in percentile estimation and norm
#' data modeling.
#'
#' This function computes standardized raking weights to overcome biases in norm
#' samples. It generates weights, by drawing on the information of population
#' shares (e. g. for sex, ethnic group, region ...) and subsequently reduces the
#' influence of over-represented groups or increases underrepresented cases. The
#' returned weights are either raw or standardized and scaled to be larger than 0.
#'
#' @param data data.frame with norm sample data.
#' @param population.margins A data.frame including three columns, specifying the
#' variable name in the original dataset used for data stratification, the factor
#' level of the variable and the according population share.
#' @param standardized If TRUE (default), the raking weights are scaled to
#' weights/min(weights)
#' @return a vector with the standardized weights
#' @export
